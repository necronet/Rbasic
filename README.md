# Playground for R basics

Nothing but a quick set of script to play around with R studio and packages. A sink to collect different paper/tutorial/exercises for R that otherwise would not qualify to be part of a standalone project.

## Clustering

Example in regards of building simple implementation of known algorithm for clustering such as k-means and EM maximization.

## Regression

Application of different regression approach in multiple datasets and how to plot the common problems like collinearity or il-form matrix for the normal equation and how to deal with such problems.

## R4DS

Example from the book [R for Data science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/). Includes personal answers and some extra work example always following the book topic of tidyverse.
